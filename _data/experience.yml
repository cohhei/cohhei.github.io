      <b>Data Engineering</b> - I joined the industry-university collaboration project using IoT technologies as a data engineer. I build and maintain a back-end system by myself for data science. The system gathers and collects data from IoT devices, stores it to TreasureData, and controls batch processings. It consists of multiple Docker containers and works on <a href="https://www.openshift.com/container-platform">OpenShift</a>, RedHat's container-based PaaS platform because frequent changes are required for the project.

      <b>CAD automation tools</b> - I worked at IHI SCube as a developer. My jobs were&#058;
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Developing CAD automation tools.</li>
        <li>Designing, developing, and maintaining it for CAD users in heavy industory company.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>User analysis</b> - I started a user analysis project by myself to visualize users' usage history of the CAD tools because we, developers were unable to know how many users used it and what tool was the most frequently used. I inserted a program to visualize those into the CAD tools, improved the developing and maintaining process, and reduced their cost.
