    <h4>Data Engineering</h4>
    <p>
      I joined the industry-university collaboration project using IoT technologies as a data engineer. I build and maintain a back-end system for data science by myself. The system gathers and collects data from IoT devices, stores it to TreasureData, and controls batch processings. It consists of multiple Docker containers and works on <a href="https://www.openshift.com/container-platform">OpenShift</a>, RedHat's container-based PaaS platform because frequent changes are required for the project. 
    </p>
